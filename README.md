# Development-of-a-measurement-method-for-Capacitive-Imaging-based-on-impedance-bridging
This thesis work focuses on the analysis and development of new methodologies of 
measurement for capacitive imaging. Capacitive imaging is an advanced approach for the 
visualization and characterization of dielectric or weakly conductive materials, which 
which exploits variations in the electrical capacitance of the sensor-sample system to 
obtain images of the internal structure of the material in order to visualize 
potential defects/heterogeneities present within it. The thesis explores approaches 
numerical and experimental, data acquisition methodologies and processing algorithms, 
providing an overview of current capacitive imaging methodologies 
presenting alternatives. In particular, a 
new measurement methodology for capacitive imaging based on a bridge of 
impedances. The realized measurement system takes advantage of the high sensitivity of the bridge to 
capacitance variations to offer the capacitive imaging landscape an alternative that is 
that is simple, effective, and does not require expensive instrumentation for 
signal conditioning. The results obtained on test samples having 
dissimilar dielectrics confirm the validity and robustness of the system devised.
